# Analysis Information

This part of the repository is for analysis and exploration of
Synthea data and its potential use cases.

This folder is divided into data (used in or exported from the notebooks)
and the notebooks themselves.

## Current Requirements

You must have the following installed:

- Python3.8^ (preferably python3.9)

Then you can install the required specific python packages:

```bash
pip3 install jupyter rich pandas
```

And then you can run and modify the notebooks at your leisure. ðŸ˜ƒ

If you wish only to examine the notebooks output/content, and do not care about _live_ interaction, you can view the notebooks on GitHub and explore the data folder.
